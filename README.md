## Getting Started


A user model created is in the prisma folder in prisma.schema

Basic email and password authentication and the only extra field there is admin status

login route - /api/auth/login .... You can simpky call NextAuth sign in to save time
register route - /api/auth/custom_register This must be called as an api route because the regsiter process was customized

created an audio model that i have not implemented though
